Personally I believe this could have any license whatsoever because I don't think you can claim rights on privacy policy documents.
<br>That would be a case that would be lost in front of any court. Presumably. Public documents. Documents available to an entire nation.

Anyway, I'm still not picking a license for this due to the above mentioned uncertainty. Oh, wait... yeah I forgot to mention that.
<br>I believe it, but I don't really know, do I?
